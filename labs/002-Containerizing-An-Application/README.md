# Containerizing an Application

This lab will begin our DevOps journey by running a simple Golang application locally using Docker. Containers are at the core of how Kubernetes, and many other DevOps implementations, operate. This lab will set the stage for later, more advanced, labs.

## About the Application
The source code for the application located in the `src/link-unshorten` directory is a simple API that we will eventually Dockerize and deploy using Kubernetes. The API takes a shortened link as a parameter in the URL and returns the destination URL as JSON. The application is built using a lightweight HTTP web framework called [Gin-Gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

### Task 1: Browse the Application
Open up the files in `src/link-unshorten` in your favorite IDE or text editor and familiarize yourself with the application.

### Task 2: Build the Docker Container Locally
In the `src/link-unshorten` directory run the following command (substituting <yourname> with your own identifier) to build the image on you laptop:
```
docker build -t <yourname>/link-unshorten:0.1 .
```

Inspect your local Docker images:
```
docker images
```

### Task 3: Run the Docker Image
To run the application using Docker use the following command:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <yourname>/link-unshorten:0.1
```

Make sure the image is running without any errors:
```
docker ps
```
Visit `http://localhost:8080/api/check?url=bit.ly/test`

### Bonus: Change the value for `port` in main.go an environment variable instead of a hardcoded value

Hint 1: Check out the [OS](https://golang.org/pkg/os) package for Golang

Hint 2: Use the `-e` flag to pass an environment variable into your `docker run` command

Hint 3: Yes, the answer is commented in the source code

Hint 4: You will need to run `docker stop` on the first running container before running another one with the same port

### Bonus+
Check out [Anchore](https://anchore.io) and investigate some popular Docker images and their vulnerabilities. 


### Discussion Question: How would you plug a Docker vulnerability scanning utility into your current CI/CD pipeline?
